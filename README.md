**# Green Stocks Analysis**

**###### Overview of the Project**

The objective of this Stock Analysis is to provide the client a tabular presentation which contains 2017 and 2018 stocks Total Daily Volume and its corresponding Return for a more engaging and quick examination and evaluation. 

**###### Results**

2017 Stocks Analysis shows that all stocks perform really well with positive Returns except for TERP with -7.2%. Although SPWR has the largest Total Daily Volume of 2,397,200, DQ is the strongest performing stocks with 199.4% Return.

In 2018, only two stocks have positive return. RUN with 84% and ENPH with 81.9% Return. Though DQ was the top performing stocks for the year 2017, it did not do very well on 2018. In fact, among the 12 stocks, it has the worst Return of -62.6% and a Total Daily Volume of only 117, 300.

To run the original script of the analysis, you get results instantly. But with the refactored code, it takes 32 seconds in average to open each of the 2017 and 2018 analysis.

**###### Summary**

Refactoring Code is organized and easy to understand. But when you have additional codes or testing, it becomes time consuming. 
Refactoring the original vba script makes it more comprehensible to work with. But when encountering failures, it takes time to go back and forth checking for errors.
